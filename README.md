# TimerAngularApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.8.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve --open
```

or

```bash
npm start
```
Once the server is running, open your browser and the site will open at `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Goal

The goal of this project is for me to learn more about Angular.

## Features

App enables the user to create a timer with a title and a date. The countdown will start when the form is submitted, as long as it passes the validations.

- Validations :
    - Date should not be prior to the day the form is created.

### WIP

- [x] Storing the date on local storage.
- [ ] Success screen when countdown is done.
- [x] Responsive design.
